# AdventOC
This repository contains all of my Advent Of Code work. When I first discovered this site a while back, I tried to solve
what I could in Python. My code was not optimized and also inefficient. I made a second folder with the intention of redoing the code
so that it is efficent and clean. I am using Python for this because I have been using Java as of the time of this writing and I want
to review Python syntax.
